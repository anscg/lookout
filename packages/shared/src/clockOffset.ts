// user, and none of their doing — therefore used to break recording outright:
// the server refused every upload-url request before issuing a presigned URL.
//
// The server now adopts its own time for such captures, so the recording is
// never lost. This closes the other half: clients learn how far off they are
// from the server's own timestamps and correct their stamps, so a skewed clock
// costs nothing at all rather than costing precision.
