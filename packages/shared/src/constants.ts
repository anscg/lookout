 *  output. There is no "× 60 seconds" budget to spend; the encoder just
 *  allocates a per-frame quantizer from a nominal cadence.
 *
 *  At 800 kbps the browser encoder is therefore pinned at its maximum
 *  quantizer — as coarse as it is allowed to be — and still overshoots
 *  the request. The whole 0.8–2 Mbps range is byte-identical, which is
 *  why raising the shared constant 400k → 800k sharpened the desktop and

 *
 *  40 Mbps lands at ~335 KB/frame — the same order as the native encoder's
 *  CLIP_FRAME_BYTE_BUDGET. Because the allocation is per-frame and NOT
 *  per-second, this constant is cadence-independent: it needs no change
 *  when CLIP_FRAME_INTERVAL_MS moves, and the clip simply carries fewer
 *  frames. Measured over a full 15-frame clip (the 4s-cadence shape),

 *
 *  so even incompressible content sat at 40% of the cap; at 6 frames/min
 *  the same content is under half of that. (0.37 MB matches the ~400 KB/min
 *  these clips were measured at in the field, which is what makes the rest
