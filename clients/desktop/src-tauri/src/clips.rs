//! Per-minute clip recording: encoding capture-loop frames into the
//! `format=mp4` (or, on the Linux VP9 fallback, `format=webm`) upload
//! payload for sessions with clips enabled.
//!
//! One `ClipRecorder` lives per upload interval: the capture loop pushes a
//! frame every `frameIntervalMs` (server-authoritative, 10s = 6/min), and
//! at the upload tick `finish()` produces the container bytes plus the
//! `ClipFormat` they are in. Encoding uses what the OS already has — no
//! bundled codecs:
//!
//! - macOS:   AVAssetWriter (VideoToolbox underneath), muxes MP4 itself
//! - Windows: Media Foundation sink writer (hardware MFT when available)
//! - Linux:   GStreamer (already a dependency for PipeWire capture)
//!
//! THE CADENCE IS THE THING. Clip frames sit whole seconds apart in media
//! time, which is nothing like the video these encoders are tuned for, and
//! every platform has needed the same two facts spelled out to it: the real
//! frame rate (so a per-second bitrate buys CLIP_FRAME_BYTE_BUDGET per
//! frame) and an explicit keyframe interval (so the clip carries ONE IDR
//! instead of reading every frame as a new scene — see
//! CLIP_KEYFRAME_INTERVAL). Anything added here should assume an encoder
//! will get sub-1fps wrong until told otherwise.
//!
//! Every error is recoverable by design: the capture loop falls back to
//! the legacy one-JPEG-per-minute upload for that interval, so a broken
//! encoder degrades smoothness, never the recording.
