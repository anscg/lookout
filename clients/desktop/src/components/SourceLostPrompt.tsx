/**
 * The "pick a source again" prompt.
 *
 * When a screencast ends underneath a live recording — the user hits Stop in
 * their compositor's sharing indicator, or PipeWire restarts — the app cannot
 * quietly reconnect. Portal sessions are opened with `PersistMode::DoNot`, so
 * there is no restore token, and re-opening a cast means going back through
 * the picker. The recording itself is fine; every frame already uploaded is
 * saved and the session keeps its tracked time.
 *
 * So this asks, rather than leaving a red banner next to a UI that still looks
 * like it's recording. It has no dismiss on purpose: behind it sits a recorder
 * that can't record, and both ways out of that state are buttons here.
